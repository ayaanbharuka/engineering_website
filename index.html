      This week I worked on tinker cad and I am making a rube golberg machine.
      I also worked on making a toaster in cad.
     This weeking I am going to hang out with friends.

    This week I finished my tinker cad of my rude golberg machine.  I got a group and am now gonna make a better one with my group.
    I am going to San Francisco this weekend.

    This week my group and I are working on our rube goldberg machine with cardboard.  
    On thursday we did a challenge as a group and we used 1 piece of paper and put a marble inside of it and made it float for 5 minutes in water.

    This week my group and I were trying to get ideas of how to make a soda bottle fly into a field goal pole using a pump. A couple ideas we had were using coke and mentos.  These ideas were good but it had some errors when we acutlly thought about it.

this week my group and I fully made our project.  We made it so we can put coke inside of the bottle and fill it with air.  It will then fly after we release the air and it should fly really far.    <br>

On friday we launched our rocket and it did not go as planned. We realized that putting coke and mentos would make it not work.  So our rocket didn't go far at all and probably went 4 feet far then fell.  We then tried again, but got the same result, but the second was with just coke.    </h1>

     This week we used learned aobut environmental engineering.  In environmental engineering we learned how to make a filter for water.  We used cotton balls, rocks, dirt, and soil.  we then put dirty water inside of the filter and most of the dirty water got clean and we got a lot better and clean water.

This week, we started learning about electrical engineering.  To start electrical engineering, i started working with breadboards on tinker cad.  In tinker cad i worked on it by using batterys with around 9v and we used a led light and a resister to try and make the led light glow.  Next week we are going to work on a bread board and we will work on an actual bread board with real led lights.

This week my partner and I used a real breadboard and a real led light and tried to light it up.  We used a 9v battery and a resister to not use too many volts in the led light.  If we put too much volts into the led, the led will explode and the led will not work again.  We had three different patterns to do.  Our first pattern was that we just had to use 3 resisters in a sequence.  Then we had to use 1 resister and use three led to get powered from it.  We then use a multimeter to see the voltage and resistence from our resister.

This week, my partner and i started using the breaboard, led and the resister on the breadboard again.  This week we used an arduino and actully coded on the arduino and make aptterns and tried to make the led flash on and off with or without a delay.  On thursday for our challenge we had to build a idea so a polluted lake with bromate that can give you cancer can get prevented from giving everyone cancer and try to build a fast, reliable and a cheap solution to try and save peopele from drinking water from the river and get cancer.
