    On thursday we did a challenge as a group and we used 1 piece of paper and put a marble inside of it and made it float for 5 minutes in water.

    This week my group and I were trying to get ideas of how to make a soda bottle fly into a field goal pole using a pump. A couple ideas we had were using coke and mentos.  These ideas were good but it had some errors when we acutlly thought about it.

this week my group and I fully made our project.  We made it so we can put coke inside of the bottle and fill it with air.  It will then fly after we release the air and it should fly really far.    <br>

On friday we launched our rocket and it did not go as planned. We realized that putting coke and mentos would make it not work.  So our rocket didn't go far at all and probably went 4 feet far then fell.  We then tried again, but got the same result, but the second was with just coke.    </h1>
