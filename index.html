      This week I worked on tinker cad and I am making a rube golberg machine.
      I also worked on making a toaster in cad.
     This weeking I am going to hang out with friends.

    This week my group and I are working on our rube goldberg machine with cardboard.  
    On thursday we did a challenge as a group and we used 1 piece of paper and put a marble inside of it and made it float for 5 minutes in water.

    This week my group and I were trying to get ideas of how to make a soda bottle fly into a field goal pole using a pump. A couple ideas we had were using coke and mentos.  These ideas were good but it had some errors when we acutlly thought about it.

this week my group and I fully made our project.  We made it so we can put coke inside of the bottle and fill it with air.  It will then fly after we release the air and it should fly really far.    <br>

On friday we launched our rocket and it did not go as planned. We realized that putting coke and mentos would make it not work.  So our rocket didn't go far at all and probably went 4 feet far then fell.  We then tried again, but got the same result, but the second was with just coke.    </h1>

     This week we used learned aobut environmental engineering.  In environmental engineering we learned how to make a filter for water.  We used cotton balls, rocks, dirt, and soil.  we then put dirty water inside of the filter and most of the dirty water got clean and we got a lot better and clean water.

This week, we started learning about electrical engineering.  To start electrical engineering, i started working with breadboards on tinker cad.  In tinker cad i worked on it by using batterys with around 9v and we used a led light and a resister to try and make the led light glow.  Next week we are going to work on a bread board and we will work on an actual bread board with real led lights.

This week my partner and I used a real breadboard and a real led light and tried to light it up.  We used a 9v battery and a resister to not use too many volts in the led light.  If we put too much volts into the led, the led will explode and the led will not work again.  We had three different patterns to do.  Our first pattern was that we just had to use 3 resisters in a sequence.  Then we had to use 1 resister and use three led to get powered from it.  We then use a multimeter to see the voltage and resistence from our resister.

This week, my partner and i started using the breaboard, led and the resister on the breadboard again.  This week we used an arduino and actully coded on the arduino and make aptterns and tried to make the led flash on and off with or without a delay.  On thursday for our challenge we had to build a idea so a polluted lake with bromate that can give you cancer can get prevented from giving everyone cancer and try to build a fast, reliable and a cheap solution to try and save peopele from drinking water from the river and get cancer.

This week we got split up into groups of three.  In our group we are basically working on our final for this class. We are using hard uncooked noodles to make a bridge looking support that is strong.  Later after we are done we are going to use buckets of water to hold the water and to try to keep the water up without falling.

This week my group and I made a lot of test ideas that we wanted to use on our final.  we tested one of ours and it broke really fast.  So we made some improvments.  In our new one, we used the same design but we made it more sturdier and added extra support.  We are now going to start to make our final one.

This week my group and I worked on our project again and we actually finished our final project.  We never tested it because we didn't have enough time to build a new one.  thats why I do not A FULL VIDEO OF OUR ACTUAL TEST.  We hope our project works and we get a good grade.

This week we got put into groups of three.  In the groups of three we had to make a product for something like shark tank.  Thinking of products and how people would want to invest in them. Then, we ended up choosing Instant snow.  We chose this because it is very good for decoration and kids can also have fun with snow.  In the link attached, it is our slides presentation.  Nothing is final in the presentation.

This week we kept working on our project.  On monday, we presented our project to the class.  One of the other students decided to offer us 180k for 15 percent.  After accepting the deal, my group and I realized that we made the wrong decision and we lost a lot of money.  Even though we lost money, it was fun to present and make a deal with someone.  Now, on friday, which is tomorrow we might have a challenge day, because we haven't done one in over 3 weeks.  This weekend I don't know what i am doing yet.  My dad left for India on tuesday and my Mom left today.  So it will just be my sister, my cousin, my grandparents and I at home.

This week we got broken up into groups of two.  We are now going to work on a project for about 4-6 weeks.  Our project is to make one of three options and we choose to make a mouse trap car.  We need a lot of materials to make the car and we made a 6 page proposal for it.  This week we also had an expirement day and we made oobleck.  Oobleck is a liquidy material that if you punch or hit it won't make your hands dirty but if you let it sit in your hand it wil melt and make your hands dirty.
